# Skin-Cancer-Classification

Developed a skin cancer classification system using a Convolution neural network

Tools & amp; technologies used: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Augmentor 
The system intends to give dermatologists an automated tool to aid in early skin cancer detection and classification, improving patient outcomes and expediting the diagnosis process.
For the skin cancer classification, I have used the ISIC dataset. The dataset consists of both malignant and benign skin lesionÂ images.
